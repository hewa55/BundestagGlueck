# BundestagGlueck
Visualization of the sentiment of the German Bundestags MPs

Following a project in which I analysed a single Bundestagsession in regard to party wide sentiment, this repo contains the code to
display a dataset in which all session have been analysed in the same fashion. 
The data incl images are found in public folder.

The core script is called visualization and to be found in the main directory.

If you have any questions, please get in touch.
